# Load Using Snowflake Kafka Connector

Try loading this using the Snowflake kafka connector.

## Local Development

To make it easier to build the environment and modify the code, consider downloading the kafka tarball and the snowflake kafka connector jar files ahead of time and placing them inside the "kafka_connect/tmp" folder, which is not committed to version control. Then copy those files from the local file system into the builder.
